- Visualized:
  - Scatter plots for feature relationships, Histograms for distributions, Box plots for outlier detection.

- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

---

### Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction
- Loaded a loan prediction dataset
- Handled missing data
- Encoded categorical features
- Trained a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix
- Visualized important feature relationships

---

### Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction
- Dataset: Bank customer churn dataset
- Cleaned and encoded categorical features (gender, geography)
- Trained Decision Tree Classifier
- Visualized feature importance
- Goal:
- Identify customers likely to leave the bank

---

### Task 4: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts
- Dataset: Medical Cost Personal Dataset
- Trained a Linear Regression model to predict insurance charges
- Visualized the effect of BMI, age, and smoking status
 
- Evaluated model using:
  - **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
  - **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error)

---

## Task 5: Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction

- Dataset: Bank Marketing dataset
- Preprocessed data by handling missing values and encoding categorical features using Label Encoding
- Visualized data through:
- Personal Loan Acceptance by Job, Detected strong relationships and multicollinearity, Job vs Age to identify spread and       outliers, and Feature Importance Plot highlighting top predictors of loan acceptance.

- Trained a Random Forest Classifier for prediction
- Evaluated using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.

## Insights & Learnings

Through these internship tasks, I gained valuable hands-on experience in applying Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to solve real-world problems. Key learnings include:

- Data Preprocessing – handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize distributions, correlations, and outliers.
- Model Building & Evaluation – training classification and regression models, interpreting results through metrics like       accuracy, MAE, RMSE, and confusion matrices.
- Feature Engineering – identifying and selecting important features that improve model performance.
- Real-World Applications – predicting loan approvals, insurance costs, customer churn, and more.
- Tools & Workflow – improving my proficiency in Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook for end-to-end data projects.

This internship has strengthened my problem-solving skills, improved my ability to work with diverse datasets, and enhanced my confidence in implementing ML solutions from scratch.
